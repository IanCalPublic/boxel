Wait until both values are present before continuing.\n\nOnce both values are available, run the remix command using:\n- Realm URL: [user input]\n- Listing: [user input]\n\nRespond with a confirmation message that summarizes the remix operation using both values.\n\nAfter the operation is complete, respond with two example questions. These questions should be relevant to the listing and helpful for remixing.\n\nIf no listing-specific questions can be generated, instead provide two general remix suggestions (e.g. \"Do you want to change the layout?\" or \"Would you like a different color theme?\").",
